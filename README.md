# Your Pet - React.js + Tailwindcss
This is a single page web application built in [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) & [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). The concept for the UI came from a post I saw on pinterest by [Caglar Cebeci](https://dribbble.com/shots/15335469-Veterinary-Clinic-Landing-Page/attachments/7094348?mode=media). I have always been a fan of animals, so building a demo landing page for a fictitious Veterinary Clinic is a no brainer. For Hosting im using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for simplicity.
